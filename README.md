# Fight_Alert_System
Project done as part of Mini Project

### Problem Statement:-

  Develop a machine learning algorithm that can detect fights in surveillance videos and alert nearby personnel in real time. 

### Requirements of the model:-

  ->The algorithm should be able to accurately identify fights, even in crowded or chaotic scenes.

  ->The algorithm should be able to detect fights in a variety of settings, including schools, workplaces, and public spaces.

  ->It should also have a low false positive rate, so that it does not generate too many unnecessary alerts.

### Technologies Used:-

->Deep Learning.

->OPEN CV (COMPUTER VISION).

->Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

->Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).

->TensorFlow (keras).

->matplotlib (pyplot).

->sklearn  (train_test_split).

->moviepy (MoviePy is a Python library for video editing: cutting, concatenations, title insertions, video compositing etcâ€¦)

### Architecture of machine learning model used.
