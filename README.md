# Fight_Alert_System
Develop a machine learning algorithm that can detect fights in surveillance videos and alert nearby personnel in real time. 

->The algorithm should be able to accurately identify fights, even in crowded or chaotic scenes.

->The algorithm should be able to detect fights in a variety of settings, including schools, workplaces, and public spaces.

->It should also have a low false positive rate, so that it does not generate too many unnecessary alerts.
